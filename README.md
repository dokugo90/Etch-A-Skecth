# Etch-A-Skecth

You can draw on this etch-a-sketch project with any color of your choice. You can now change the grid size to a maximum of  64 x 64 now. I will be increasing this limit often without having to sacrifice performance. 

Enjoy and draw whatever you feel. If you find there is significant delay or something is not functioning properly please do not hesitate to write down the problem you are experiencing in the comments. So I can make this a better experience for those who visit my project. Thank you.
