# Etch-A-Skecth

You can draw on this etch-a-skecth project with any color of your choice. You can even change the grid size to a maximuim of 32 x 32. I will be increasing this limit often without having to sacirfice performance. 

Enjoy and draw whatever you feel. If you find there is significant delay or something is not functioning properly please do not hestitate to write down the problem you are experiencing in the comments, so I can make this a better experience for those who visti my project. Thank you.
